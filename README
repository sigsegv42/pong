Pong! Read Me

This project is less about the game of pong and more about game engine code design. While 
it's perfectly possible to throw together a pong implementation in a half day (or less), 
the result would most likey be throw away code. Most of the work has gone into creating the 
reusable game framework.

Release Notes:

New in version 0.1.4 (02-25-08)
Version bump for v3d libraries API sync.


New in version 0.1.3 (01-17-08)
Rewrites in ui, font, audio, command library api's. Game menus are finally working again.


New in version 0.1.2 (11-07-07)
Bugfixes - initialization bug broke initial game score.


New in version 0.1.1 (11-02-07)
Separate classes for rendering - Scene graph classes no longer handle this function. New
callback system using boost signals library.


New in version 0.1.0 (10-24-07)
Latest sync with Vertical3D/QuantumXML libraries


New in version 0.0.9
No longer dependent on Xerces for xml support (using QuantumXML instead).


New in Version 0.0.7 (12-17-06)
Only a few minor code cleanups. Any significant changes are within libhookah.


New in Version 0.0.6 (12-16-06)

All of the non-pong specific code bits were moved into a separate generic engine library.
No other game changes exist in this build. The actual pong implementation has been reduced
to ~15kb of code within 9 source files (and 4 classes). The resulting engine library 
accounts for ~38kb in 15 classes within 28 sources files.
